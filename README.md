# ColorQ    
This game consists  of three levels :
1.Easy - In this level there will be two different colored blocks green and red. Now you have to click on the button with same color as the color on top of stack. For example if you have red on the top of stack then you have to click red button. Remember timer is of 15s. Maximize your score in this 15s. But there is a twist here. Color of each block randomly changes in every 2ums.

2.Medium - It is same as easy but it contains three different colors without random change in every 2s.
3.Hard - It is same as medium but color changes randomly every 2s.

Actually it is my first development project or first application. So I was not able to make something great. But I learnt a great stuff from this game. Many basics of JS and HTML/CSS I came to know while creating this game. Thanks for visiting.
